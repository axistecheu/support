## Overview

Icons are used throughout the entire Filament UI to visually communicate core parts of the user experience. To render icons, we use the [Blade Icons](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) package from Blade UI Kit.

They have a website where you can [search all the available icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) from various Blade Icons packages. Each package contains a different icon set that you can choose from.

## Using custom SVGs as icons

The [Blade Icons] package allows you to register custom SVGs as icons. This is useful if you want to use your own custom icons in Filament.

To start with, publish the Blade Icons configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-icons
```

Now, open the `config/blade-icons.php` file, and uncomment the `default` set in the `sets` array.

Now that the default set exists in the config file, you can simply put any icons you want inside the `resources/svg` directory of your application. For example, if you put an SVG file named `star.svg` inside the `resources/svg` directory, you can reference it anywhere in Filament as `icon-star`. The `icon-` prefix is configurable in the `config/blade-icons.php` file too. You can also render the custom icon in a Blade view using the [`@svg('icon-star')` directive](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#directive).

## Replacing the default icons

Filament includes an icon management system that allows you to replace any icons are used by default in the UI with your own. This happens in the `boot()` method of any service provider, like `AppServiceProvider`, or even a dedicated service provider for icons. If you wanted to build a plugin to replace Heroicons with a different set, you could absolutely do that by creating a Laravel package with a similar service provider.

To replace an icon, you can use the `FilamentIcon` facade. It has a `register()` method, which accepts an array of icons to replace. The key of the array is the unique icon "alias" that identifies the icon in the Filament UI, and the value is an `Icon` object that represents the icon that should be used instead:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentIcon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Icon;

FilamentIcon::register([
    'panels::global-search.input.prefix' => Icon::make('fas-magnifying-glass'),
    'panels::sidebar.group.collapse' => Icon::make('fas-chevron-up'),
]);
```

### Customizing the size of icons

By default, Filament will use [Tailwind classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height) to set the size of icons. To customize the size of an icon you have registered, you can use the `size()` method of the `Icon` object, and pass in a set of CSS classes to use instead:

```php
use Filament\Support\Icons\Icon;

Icon::make('fas-magnifying-glass')
    ->size('h-6 w-6')
```

### Customizing the color of icons

By default, Filament will use [Tailwind classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-color) to set the color of icons. To customize the color of an icon you have registered, you can use the `color()` method of the `Icon` object, and pass in a set of CSS classes to use instead:

```php
use Filament\Support\Icons\Icon;

Icon::make('fas-magnifying-glass')
    ->color('text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-500')
```

### Adding additional classes to icons

You can use the `class()` method of the `Icon` object, and pass in a set of additional CSS classes to add to the SVG:

```php
use Filament\Support\Icons\Icon;

Icon::make('fas-magnifying-glass')
    ->class('global-search-input-icon')
```

### Customizing the appearance of icons without changing the SVG

When registering icons using `FilamentIcon::register()`, you don't need to pass the name of a new icon to use. By using an `Icon` object without a name, you can customize the [size](#customizing-the-size-of-icons), [color](#customizing-the-color-of-icons), and [additional classes](#adding-additional-classes-to-icons) of an icon without changing the SVG:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentIcon;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Icon;

FilamentIcon::register([
    'panels::global-search.input.prefix' => Icon::make()
        ->size('h-6 w-6')
        ->color('text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-500')
        ->class('global-search-input-icon'),
]);
```

### Allowing users to customize icons from your plugin

If you have built a Filament plugin, your users may want to be able to customize icons in the same way that they can with any core Filament package. This is possible if you replace any manual `@svg()` usages with the `<x-filament::icon>` Blade component. This component allows you to pass in an icon alias, the name of the SVG icon that should be used by default, default size classes, default color classes, and additional classes or HTML attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::icon
    name="heroicon-m-magnifying-glass"
    alias="panels::global-search.input.prefix"
    color="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"
    size="h-5 w-5"
    wire:target="search"
/>
```
